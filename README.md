This repository currently contains a democratized implementation of the AlphaFold distance prediction network.       

The associated publication is currently under review, and can be found here on biorXiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/830273v1   

ProSPr is available as a Docker container. After installing Docker, run:   
*docker run prospr/prospr*  
To build your own docker container after modifying this source code, run:   
*docker build .*   

All of the data used to train the ProSPr models (~2TB) is publically accessible at https://byu.box.com/v/ProteinStructurePrediction
